## About

The project realized aims to create a graph-database containing the relationships between the various Marvel products. For the realization of this project we have chosen a non-relational graph-database, built through the use of Neo4j. We have realized this project starting from two data sources, API and web scraping, that we have then integrated and on which we have then performed a quality check.

The final database is complete of the various relationships between characters, movies and comics of the Marvel world, moreover each node contains several information about its nature.
